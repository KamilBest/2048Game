# 2048 GAME (Written in C#)

"
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. 2048 was originally written in JavaScript and CSS during a weekend, and released on March 9, 2014, as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license.

The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. "
